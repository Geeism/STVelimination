Everything's stored on the `Fan Team Contest Responses` Sheet in the `FTC 2019` folder. If you examine the layout of the `Vote 2` sheet, you'll see that there are two columns containing the data that are unrelated to counting, so to neaten things up I made the `Vote 2 export` sheet.

So basically:
- Download the `Vote 2 export` sheet as a .csv
- Download `candidates` sheet as a .csv

### Step 2: running the code
The only thing that you should need to make sure of is that the two downloaded .csvs need to be in the same place as the code. Once you press run, it'll load in the data and do it's counting thing.

### Step 3: checking for discrepancies
Assuming everything went correctly, the code should generate a `FTC19_outcome.csv`.

To really make sure that things haven't been tampered with, you want to go through my code and make sure there's no part
